    "### Binary Tree\n",
    "\n",
    "Fundamentally, a binary tree is composed of nodes connected by edges (with further restrictions discussed below). Some binary tree, $t$, is either empty or consists of a single **root** element with two distinct binary tree child elements known as the **left subtree** and the **right subtree** of $t$. As the name **binary** suggests, a node in a binary tree has a *maximum* of 2 children.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following diagrams depict two different binary trees: \n",
    "![](fig/tree2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the basic facts and terms to know about binary trees:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The convention for binary tree diagrams is that the root is at the top, and the subtrees branch down from it.\n",
    "2. A node's left and right subtrees are referred to as children, and that node can be referred to as the **parent** of those subtrees.\n",
    "3. A non-root node with no children is called a **leaf**.\n",
    "4. Some node $a$ is an ancestor of some node $b$ if $b$ is located in a left or right subtree whose root node is $a$. This means that the root node of binary tree $t$ is the ancestor of all other nodes in the tree.\n",
    "5. If some node $a$ is an ancestor of some node $b$, then the path from $a$ to $b$ is the sequence of nodes starting with $a$, moving down the ancestral chain of children, and ending with $b$.\n",
    "6. The depth (or level) of some node $a$ is its distance (i.e., number of edges) from the tree's root node.\n",
    "7. Simply put, the **height** of a tree is the number of edges between the root node and its furthest leaf. More technically put, it's $1+\\text{max}(\\text{height}(\\text{leftSubtree}),\\text{height}(\\text{rightSubtree}))$ (i.e., one more than the maximum of the heights of its left and right subtrees). Any node has a height of 1, and the height of an empty subtree is -1. Because the height of each node is  the maximum height of its subtrees and an empty subtree's height is -1, the height of a single-element tree or leaf node is 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's apply some of the terms we learned above to the binary tree on the right:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The root node is $A$.\n",
    "2. The respective left and right children of $A$ are $B$ and $F$. The left child of $B$ is $C$. The respective left and right children of $E$ are $F$ and $D$.\n",
    "3. Nodes $C$, $F$, and $D$ are leaves (i.e., each node is a leaf).\n",
    "4. The root is the ancestor of all other nodes, $B$ is an ancestor of $D$, and $E$ is an ancestor of $F$ and $D$.\n",
    "5. The path between $A$ and $C$ is $A\\rightarrow B \\rightarrow C$. The path between $A$ and $F$ is $A \\rightarrow E \\rightarrow F$. The path between $A$ and $D$ is $A \\rightarrow E \\rightarrow D$.\n",
    "6. The depth of root node $A$ is 0. The depth of nodes $B$ and $E$ is 1. The depth of nodes $C$, $F$, and $D$, is 2.\n",
    "7. The height of the tree, $height(t)$, is 2. We calculate this recursively as $height(t) = 1+(max(height(root.leftChild),height(root.rightChild)))$. Because this is long and complicated when expanded, we'll break it down using an image of a slightly simpler version of whose height is still : \n",
    "![](fig/tree3.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the diagram above, the height of $t$ is 2 because that is the maximum height of $t$'s left and right subtrees.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Binary Search Tree\n",
    "\n",
    "A Binary Search Tree (BST), $t$, is a binary tree that is either empty or satisfies the following three conditions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Each element in the left subtree of $t$ is less than or equal to the root element of  (i.e., $max(leftTree(t).value)\\le t.value$).\n",
    "2. Each element in the right subtree of $t$ is greater than the root element of $t$ (i.e.,$max(rightTree(t).value \\gt t.value)$ ).\n",
    "3. Both $leftTree(t)$ and $rightTree(t)$ are BSTs.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can essentially think of it as a regular binary tree where for each node **parent** having a $leftChild$ and $rightChild$, $leftChild.value\\le parent.value \\gt rightChild.value$. In the first diagram at the top of this article, the binary tree of integers on the left side is a binary search tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages and Drawbacks of BSTs\n",
    "\n",
    "* Searching for elements is very fast. <br>\n",
    "We know that each node has a maximum of two children and we know that the $\\le$ items are always in the left subtree and the $\\gt$ items are always in the right subtree. To search for an element, we simply need to compare the value we want against the value stored in the root node of the current subtree and work our way down the appropriate child subtrees until we either find the value we're looking for or we hit null (i.e., an empty subtree) which indicates the item is not in the BST. Inserting or searching for a node in a **balanced** tree is $O(\\log n)$ because you're discarding half of the possible values each time you go left or right.\n",
    "* It can easily become **unbalanced**.<br>\n",
    "Depending on the insertion order, the tree can very easily become unbalanced (which makes for longer search times). For example, if we create a new tree where the sequence of inserted nodes is $2 \\rightarrow 1 \\rightarrow 3 \\rightarrow 4 \\rightarrow 5 \\rightarrow 6$, we end up with the following unbalanced tree: \n",
    "![](fig/tree4.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Observe that the root's left subtree only has one node, whereas the root's right subtree has four nodes. For this reason, inserting or searching for a node in an unbalanced tree is $O(n)$."

    "# Problem: Is this a Binary Search Tree?\n",
    "\n",
    "For the purposes of this challenge, we define a binary search tree to be a binary tree with the following ordering properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The data value of every node in a node's left subtree is less than the data value of that node.\n",
    "* The data value of every node in a node's right subtree is greater than the data value of that node.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the root node of a binary tree, can you determine if it's also a binary search tree?\n",
    "\n",
    "Complete the function in your editor below, which has 1 parameter: a pointer to the root of a binary tree. It must return a boolean denoting whether or not the binary tree is a binary search tree. You may have to write one or more helper functions to complete this challenge.\n",

    "**Note:** We do not consider a binary tree to be a binary search tree if it contains duplicate values.\n",
